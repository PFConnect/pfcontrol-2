# PFControl v2

- `npm run dev` takes the .env.development and starts vite and the dev server
- `npm run prod` just runs the server with the .env.production

If you need the `.env` files please contact Banana or Linuss.

### Our current plan is to open-source PFControl v2, so please don't write gibberish code.
